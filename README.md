Objective:
-To build a quiz that has multiple choice answers and is timed. 
-If you get the answer right the time stays the same but if you get the question incorrect it deducts 15 seconds from your time.
-if you do not complete the quiz it alerts you to refresh and start again.
-If you do complete the quiz a leader board will appear asking for your initials. This will be saved in local data so you can compare scores later.

Main Concepts Used:
- Functions
- for Each loop
- setInterval
- ClassItem.add or remove
- If Else statements

Take away:

    I had a hard time creating this and understanding how all functions come together and work together to keep this moving. If I had more time I would
have added the leader board and had an end game function that kept score. This was an extremly hard assignment for me but I learned a ton.
